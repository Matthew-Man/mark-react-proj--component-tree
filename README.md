We've been working with [our very first React app](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-react-proj--meet-react), where we modified an existing component and defined our own!

Now, we're going to see how we can start working with multiple components and begin to assemble a component tree.

## Learning Outcomes

- Render a React component from within another
- Draw out the component tree of an app
- Explore components using Developer Tools

## Exercise 1: Installing and demoing

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** you can view the React web app on `localhost:3000`

Firstly, clone this repository to your local machine in some sensible place, for example:

```bash
cd ~/Development/Academy # or wherever you're organising everything
git clone https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-react-proj--component-tree.git
```

Then, change into the new directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd mark-react-proj--component-tree
yarn
```

Finally, run your new React app!

```bash
yarn start
```

The `start` script is configured such that the app will run by default on your local machine at `localhost:3000`, which should open up in your browser automatically (but which you can also navigate to).

## Exercise 2: Reading, understanding and documenting

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a document which outlines how you think this React app works. You don't have to achieve a theory which explains 100%, but you should strive to explain as much as possible.

(N.B.: The _correctness_ of your theory is **much less important** than the _process_ of forming this document. [Forming a prediction, and then discovering it was wrong, is an effective way to learn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959475217303468)!)

1. Take some time to read and digest the code
2. Google things that you don't understand
3. Experiment with changing things
4. Produce a narrative document

> ⚠️ For now, you will have to refresh `localhost:3000` when you make changes to see them take effect. _(Instructor note: CRA hot reload / fast refresh seems not to be able to watch code inside `index.tsx`.)_

A good narrative document will include some indication of hierarchy between components - how they fit together, in a so-called 'component tree' (like [this simple example](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image3.png)).

## Exercise 3: React Dev Tools

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a component tree diagram for this app.

Add the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) as an extension in Google Chrome. It can be used via the inspector, read the overview for an intro and then try it out by inspecting this app. 

Notice how the component names relate to those in the source code, and draw a component tree diagram for this app. 

## Exercise 4: Thinking in components

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a component tree diagram for an app or website of your choice.

Read these two articles:

1. [Atomic Design and UI Components: Theory to Practice](https://blog.bitsrc.io/atomic-design-and-ui-components-theory-to-practice-f200db337c24)
2. [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)

Then pick an app or website that you like, and see if you can reverse-engineer a component tree diagram from it.

## Exercise 4: Check your understanding

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** a conversation with a Faculty member and amended comments.

Talk to a member of Faculty about your understanding of the game and of TypeScript.

Amend your notes for any important points that come out of the conversation.

## Exercise 5: Commentary and reflection

> 🎯 **Success criterion:** documented reflections.
